Problem: Bookstore API 
You have been tasked with building a simple Bookstore API using Spark Java. The API should allow users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books. Each book should have a title, author, and ISBN.

Requirements:

1. Create a new book: The API should allow users to add a new book to the bookstore by providing the title, author, and ISBN.

2. Retrieve all books: The API should provide an endpoint to retrieve all books available in the bookstore.

3. Retrieve a specific book: The API should provide an endpoint to retrieve the details of a specific book based on its ISBN.

4. Update a book: The API should allow users to update the details of a book (title, author) based on its ISBN.

5. Delete a book: The API should provide an endpoint to delete a book from the bookstore based on its ISBN.

6. Error handling: Proper error handling should be implemented for cases such as invalid requests, missing books, etc. Appropriate error responses with corresponding HTTP status codes should be returned.

Tasks:

1. Set up a Spark Java application with the necessary dependencies.

2. Define the necessary routes and handlers to implement the CRUD operations for books.

3. Implement the logic for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting books.

4. Test the API using a REST client or tool like Postman to ensure that the endpoints are working correctly.

5. Handle errors and edge cases, such as handling invalid requests and providing appropriate error responses.

6. Document the API endpoints and provide clear instructions on how to use them.

7. Bonus: Implement data persistence by storing the books in a database or a file to retain data between server restarts.

Note: You can choose to store the books in memory or use a database of your choice. The focus of this task is on implementing the API endpoints and ensuring their functionality.

This mini task will help you practice building a basic RESTful API using Spark Java and handling CRUD operations. It covers essential concepts such as routing, request handling, and error handling.
